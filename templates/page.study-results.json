This product validation study was designed to test the effectiveness of Smart Nora.<\/p>\n          <p>The research team first confirmed a statistically significant link between Snorers' snoring (measured objectively using the Do I Snore app) and Partners' sleep (measured objectively using the sleep monitoring device S+ by ResMed).<\/p>\n          <p>More snoring was associated with poorer sleep among Partners (i.e., longer time to fall asleep, longer time awake during the night, worse sleep efficiency, worse sleep maintenance) before using Smart Nora. This finding was confirmed when including the Smart Nora use period in the analyses.<\/p>\n          <p>The study was independently designed, conducted, and reported by the SleepScore Labs. The study was conducted by Sharon Danoff-Burg, PhD, Holly Rus, PhD, Thijs Walbeek, MS, Luis Cruz Martir, BA, Jennifer Kim, BS, Roy Raymann, PhD.
