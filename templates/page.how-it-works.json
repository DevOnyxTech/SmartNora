We recommend using Smart Nora for 7–14 consecutive nights to achieve optimal results. Many users see results in the first few nights, and the majority of our users experience a reduction in their snoring after 7 consecutive nights of using Smart Nora.</p>"

            "question": "How does the motion of the pillow not wake up the snorer?",
            "answer": "<p>Once the motion of the pillow becomes a familiar element, you will no longer notice it. In fact, one of the functions of our brain is to recognize familiar elements in the sleep environment and ignore them.<br/><br/>Many Nora users don't feel the motion of the pillow from the first night. Depending on how much of a light sleeper you are, it can take up to 14 nights to fully get used to the movement. The years of uninterrupted sleep afterward are certainly worth it!</p>"

            "question": "Will Smart Nora work if I sleep on my side?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. Smart Nora's Pillow Insert has a folding structure that rises equally across the length of your pillow. This way, you can put your head anywhere and sleep in any position. Whether you prefer to sleep on your back, stomach or side, Nora will still provide a gentle rise and fall motion under your head to stimulate your throat muscles and reduce your snoring.</p>"

            "question": "Can I use my own pillow?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes! Smart Nora is designed to work with your favorite pillow. The slow movement of Smart Nora’s insert is transferred through the pillow to your head, so the thickness, shape, or softness of your pillow doesn’t affect Smart Nora’s performance. While you can use any pillow type, we do recommend using a queen-size pillow (50 x 70 cm / 20 x 30 inches) to ensure Smart Nora's Pillow Insert is edge-to-edge under your pillow.</p>"

            "question": "How is Smart Nora different from other snoring solutions?",
            "answer": "<p>Other solutions attempt to reduce snoring by putting your head in a specific position (like specialty pillows) or by physically moving your jaw and tongue (like mouthguards, a.k.a. Mandibular Repositioning Devices), which are uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Smart Nora interrupts snoring with a fundamentally different method. By using a gentle movement, Nora stimulates the muscles that support the airway. The airway resumes its normal open position, and the snorer's breathing stays silent. No need to wake up or be forced to sleep in a specific position.<br/><br/>Nora's movement only begins when you are about to snore, preventing you from going into a loud snoring episode.</p>"
